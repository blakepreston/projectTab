            <p>KeepIt is an iOS App built to help users keep track of 
                all their personal belongings without the use of gps 
                hardware. It does this through customizable notifications 
                that can be timed or triggered upon crossing the border of 
                a personalized GeoFence. Whenever you lose an item, you can 
                use KeepIt to remember where you had it last.
